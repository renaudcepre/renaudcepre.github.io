> Initially passionate about electronic music, my steps naturally approached the digital world via sound synthesis and the realization of virtual synthesizers, especially on NI Reaktor.
I decided to go into software development by starting a formation at the 42 school, which made me discover a whole new world, from C language and low level programming to web development.

## Me

Apart from development and computer science, I do a lot of biking, mountain biking, some climbing and skateboarding. I'm still a music lover in general, even if I do less than before since I started developing.
