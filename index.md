Initially passionate about electronic music, my steps naturally approached the digital world via sound synthesis and the realization of virtual synthesizers, especially on NI Reaktor.
I decided to go into software development by starting a formation at the 42 school, which made me discover a whole new world, from C language and low level programming to web development.

## ðŸ’¡ Projects

> I currently work on a [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy) project manager for little organizations on Django, that I should make public soon.

The following projects are mainly 42 school projects:
 
 - [corewar](https://gitlab.com/rcepre/corewar) - A programming game in which programs compete for control of a virtual machine.
 - [lemin](https://gitlab.com/rcepre/lemin) - Graphs and path-finding algorithms.
 - [abstract-vm](https://gitlab.com/rcepre/abstract-vm) - Stack-machine implementation in C++ (equivalent of the unix `dc` command) 
 - [cpp-containers](https://gitlab.com/rcepre/cpp_containers) - An attempt to implement the C++ STL containers. Works, but remains a work in progress
 - [malloc](https://gitlab.com/rcepre/malloc) - A little implementation of malloc in C

## ðŸ‘¤ Me

Apart from development and computer science, I do a lot of cycling, mountain biking, some climbing and skateboarding. I'm still a music lover in general, even if I do less than before since I started developing.
